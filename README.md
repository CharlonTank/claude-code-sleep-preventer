## The Problem

You ask your coding agent to refactor your codebase. It's going to take 10 minutes. You close your MacBook lid to grab coffee...

**💀 Mac sleeps. The agent stops. Work lost.**

## The Solution

Install this tool. Now your Mac stays awake while your agent works, even with the lid closed. When it finishes, normal sleep resumes.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 😴 Lid closed = Mac sleeps | ☕ Lid closed = agent keeps working |
| 🔄 Come back to interrupted work | ✅ Come back to finished work |

## Installation

### 🍎 Download DMG (Easiest)

1. [Download the latest DMG](https://github.com/CharlonTank/agents-sleep-preventer/releases/latest/download/AgentsSleepPreventer-4.0.2.dmg)
2. Drag `AgentsSleepPreventer.app` to Applications
3. Launch the app - it will auto-configure on first run
4. Restart Claude Code or Codex

The menu bar app uses Sparkle for in-app updates and can download + install new signed releases directly.

### 🍺 Homebrew

```bash
brew tap CharlonTank/tap
brew install agents-sleep-preventer
asp install
```

### 🦀 Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharlonTank/agents-sleep-preventer.git
cd agents-sleep-preventer
cargo build --release
./target/release/asp install
```

---

## How It Works

```
You send a prompt
       ↓
   Agent starts working → 🔒 Sleep disabled
       ↓
   Agent finishes → 🔓 Sleep re-enabled
```

That's it. No configuration needed.

---

## Commands

```bash
asp status     # Check current state
asp cleanup    # Clean up after interrupts
asp uninstall  # Remove completely
```

## FAQ

**Does it drain my battery?**
No more than usual. Your Mac just stays awake instead of sleeping.

**What if I interrupt an agent with Ctrl+C?**
Run `asp cleanup` or the tool auto-detects idle sessions after 30 seconds.

**Does it work with multiple agent instances?**
Yes! Mac stays awake until ALL instances finish.

**How do app updates work?**
The menu bar app uses Sparkle. Use `Check for Updates...` from the menu bar app, or let Sparkle check automatically in the background. New signed releases are installed through Sparkle instead of just opening a DMG download.
