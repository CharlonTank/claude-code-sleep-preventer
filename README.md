## The Problem

You ask Claude to refactor your codebase. It's going to take 10 minutes. You close your MacBook lid to grab coffee...

**💀 Mac sleeps. Claude stops. Work lost.**

## The Solution

Install this tool. Now your Mac stays awake while Claude works, even with the lid closed. When Claude finishes, normal sleep resumes.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 😴 Lid closed = Mac sleeps | ☕ Lid closed = Claude keeps working |
| 🔄 Come back to interrupted work | ✅ Come back to finished work |

## Installation

### 🍎 Download DMG (Easiest)

1. [Download the latest DMG](https://github.com/CharlonTank/claude-code-sleep-preventer/releases/latest/download/ClaudeSleepPreventer-3.0.2.dmg)
2. Drag `ClaudeSleepPreventer.app` to Applications
3. Launch the app - it will auto-configure on first run

## How It Works

```
You send a prompt
       ↓
   Claude starts working → 🔒 Sleep disabled
       ↓
   Claude finishes → 🔓 Sleep re-enabled
```

That's it. No configuration needed.

## FAQ

**Does it drain my battery?**
No more than usual. Your Mac just stays awake instead of sleeping.

**What if I interrupt Claude with Ctrl+C?**
Run `claude-sleep-preventer cleanup` or the tool auto-detects idle sessions after 10 seconds.

**Does it work with multiple Claude instances?**
Yes! Mac stays awake until ALL instances finish.

**How do app updates work?**
Open the menu bar app and use `Check for Updates...`, or wait for the automatic background check. When a new version is available, the app opens the latest DMG download from GitHub Releases.
